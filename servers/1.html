  get in.

  <p>Email this email: kraftspektra@gmail.com.</p>

  <p>512MB ram. Spigot 1.10.2. 5GB storage. 5 Plugins.</p>
  <p><h2>Cons and limitations:</h2></p>
  <p>No direct file access. You have to be someone I know as a friend. You will need to text me on skype what changes you 
  want. You will have to keep your server private, and with your friends. It has to be whitelisted, if this is broken, your server will be
  shut down.</p>
  <p><h2>Notes:</h2></p>
  <p>If the other server does not get taken, you will have full access to your server files. Please send emails from 17.8.16 to 21.8.16. You will 
  get your own subdomain. If you named your server cheese, the ip would be cheese.spektra.xyz.
