  <p><h3>Trikki_Boy</h3></p>
  <p><h4>Trikki is the owner of Spektra Kraft. He made the original in late November 2013. He is also the one who pays for the new server (spektra.xyz).
  If you need to know who he is in the game, you can tell him apart from everyone else because in red before his name, it will say: [Owner]</h4></p>

  If you need to know who he is in the game, you can tell her apart from everyone else because in red before her name, it will say: [Co-Owner]</h4></p>
